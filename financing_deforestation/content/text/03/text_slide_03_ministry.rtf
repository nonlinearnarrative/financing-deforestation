\f0\fs24 \cf0 \'93I would like to inform you in the following about the involvement of the Dutch government in the development and protection of parts of the Amazon in Brazil.\
Brazil has been investing for years in the development of a corridor in the North of Brazil, the so-called Corredor Centro-Norte. Through the diplomatic network in Brazil, the Dutch government has the opportunity to make Dutch companies and knowledge institutes aware of these project offers. The Dutch diplomatic network in Brazil informs entrepreneurs from the Kingdom of the Netherlands of the opportunities and challenges in the field of corporate social responsibility and sustainability in  development of large infrastructure projects in Brazil.\'94}
